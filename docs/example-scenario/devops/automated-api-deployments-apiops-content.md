APIOps is a methodology that applies the concepts of GitOps and [DevOps](/devops) to API deployment. Like DevOps, [APIOps](https://github.com/Azure/apiops) helps team members easily make changes and deploy them in an iterative and automated way. This architecture demonstrates how you can improve the entire API lifecycle and API quality by using APIOps.

### Workflow

1. API operators run the [extractor pipeline](https://azure.github.io/apiops/apiops/3-apimTools/apiops-2-1-tools-extractor.html) to synchronize the Git repository with the API Management instance and populate the Git repository with API Management objects in the required format.

2. If an API change is detected in the API Management instance, a pull request (PR) is created for operators to review. Operators merge the changes into the Git repository.

3. API developers clone the Git repository, create a branch, and create API definitions by using the OpenAPI Specification or tools of their choice.

4. If a developer pushes changes to the repository, a PR is created for review.

5. The PR can be automatically approved or reviewed, depending on the level of control that's required.

6. After changes are approved and merged, the publishing pipeline deploys the latest changes to the API Management instance.

7. API operators create and modify API Management policies, diagnostics, products, and other relevant objects, and then commit the changes.

8. The changes are reviewed, and they're merged after approval.

9. After merging the changes, the publishing pipeline deploys the changes by using the API-definitions process.

### Components

- [Azure API Management](/azure/well-architected/service-guides/api-management/reliability) is a managed service that creates consistent, API gateways for back-end services. In this architecture, it routes API calls, verifies credentials, enforces usage quotas, and logs metadata. It serves as the central platform for managing and publishing APIs.

- [Azure DevOps](/azure/devops/user-guide/what-is-azure-devops) is a suite of development tools and services that manages the development life cycle. In this architecture, it supports planning, code management, and automated deployment of APIs, which enables teams to collaborate and streamline API delivery.

  - [Azure Pipelines](/azure/devops/pipelines/get-started/what-is-azure-pipelines) is a cloud-based service that enables continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD). In this architecture, it automates testing, building, and deploying API changes to the API Management instance.

  - [Azure Repos](/azure/devops/repos/get-started) is a set of version control tools, including standard Git, that you can use to manage your code. In this architecture, it stores API definitions, policies, and configurations. It serves as the single source of truth for all changes and enables auditability and collaboration through pull requests.

### Alternatives

This solution supports [Azure Repos](/azure/devops/repos/) to provide Git functionality and [Azure Pipelines](/azure/devops/pipelines/get-started/what-is-azure-pipelines) for CI/CD workflows.

It also supports [GitHub](https://docs.github.com/) for source control and collaboration, along with [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/actions) to automate build, test, and deployment pipelines.

You can use any comparable technologies that provide similar version control and CI/CD capabilities.

## Scenario details

APIOps uses version control to manage APIs and create an audit trail of changes to APIs, policies, and operations.

API developers who use an APIOps methodology review and audit APIs earlier and more frequently, catching and resolving deviations from API standards faster to improve specifications and API quality. The more APIs that you build and deploy with an APIOps approach, the greater the consistency between APIs.

### Potential use cases

- Any organization developing and managing APIs
- Highly regulated industries: insurance, banking, finance, government

## Considerations

These considerations implement the pillars of the Azure Well-Architected Framework, which is a set of guiding tenets that you can use to improve the quality of a workload. For more information, see [Well-Architected Framework](/azure/well-architected/).

### Security

Security provides assurances against deliberate attacks and the misuse of your valuable data and systems. For more information, see [Design review checklist for Security](/azure/well-architected/security/checklist).

This solution provides several security-related benefits. Individual developers—and even operators—don't directly access the API Management instance to apply changes or updates. Instead, users push changes to a Git repository, and the extractor and publishing pipelines read and apply them to the API Management instance. This approach follows the security best practice of *least privilege* by not giving teams write permissions to the API Management service instance. In diagnostic or troubleshooting scenarios, you can grant elevated permissions for a limited time on a case-by-case basis.

To make sure the API Management instances are using best practices for security, you can extend this solution to enforce API best practices by using third-party tools and unit testing. Teams can provide early feedback via PR review if the proposed changes to an API or policy violate standards.

Apart from the task of setting up repository permissions, consider implementing the following security measures in Git repositories that synchronize to API Management instances:

- **Pull Request (PR) Review**: Use branches and protect the branches that represent the state of the API Management instances from having changes pushed to them directly. Require PRs to have at least one reviewer to enforce the four-eyes principle.
- **Immutable history**: Only allow new commits on top of existing changes. Immutable history is especially important for auditing purposes.
- **Multi-factor authentication**: Require your users to activate two-factor authentication.
- **Signed Commits**: Allow only signed commits that can't be altered after the fact.

### Cost Optimization

Cost Optimization focuses on ways to reduce unnecessary expenses and improve operational efficiencies. For more information, see [Design review checklist for Cost Optimization](/azure/well-architected/cost-optimization/checklist).

- Use the [Azure pricing calculator](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/calculator) to estimate costs of the Azure components in this architecture.

- Azure DevOps licensing costs should be considered for teams implementing APIOps. All users participating in the APIOps process must have an appropriate Azure DevOps license. For details, see [Azure DevOps pricing](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/devops/azure-devops-services/).
  
  For pricing and licensing details when using GitHub, see [GitHub pricing](https://github.com/pricing) and [GitHub Enterprise licensing](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-cloud@latest/admin/overview/about-github-enterprise-licensing).

### Operational Excellence

Operational Excellence covers the operations processes that deploy an application and keep it running in production. For more information, see [Design review checklist for Operational Excellence](/azure/well-architected/operational-excellence/checklist).

APIOps can increase DevOps productivity for API development and deployments. One of the most useful features is the ability to use Git operations to roll back changes that behave unexpectedly. The commit graph contains all commits, so it can help with the post-mortem analysis.

API operators often manage multiple environments for the same set of APIs. It's typical to have several stages of an API deployed to different API Management instances or in a shared API Management instance. The Git repository, which is the single source of truth, shows which versions of applications are currently deployed to a cluster.

When someone makes a PR in the Git repository, the API operator knows they have new code to review. For example, when a developer takes the OpenAPI Specification and builds the API implementation, they add this new code to the repository. The operators can review the PR and make sure that the API that's been submitted for review meets best practices and standards.

APIOps has many benefits, but as API Management landscapes grow, so does the complexity of managing them. This solution helps meet challenges like:

- Keeping an overview of all environments and API Management instances.
- Tracking critical changes to APIs and policies.
- Creating an audit trail for all deployed changes.

## Deploy this scenario
